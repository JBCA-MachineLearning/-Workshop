As the volume of information available to science increases, adoption and development of new techniques for processing this data is essential. In order to better understand the opportunities machine learning could offer data-intensive researchers, we are running a 3-day workshop that will provide introductory sessions on data exploration, a diverse range of speakers from academia and industry and networking opportunities to meet with other data-intensive researchers and professionals. Our focus for the 3 days is exploring recent advances in machine learning from fields outside astronomy and develop a better understanding of where these techniques may be best applied in our research. We encourage participants with different backgrounds and levels of experience with machine learning as the workshop will offer sessions for novices through to advanced users
